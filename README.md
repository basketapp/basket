## Basket

> **Note:** This contains a **non-final version**. Anything in this app can still be subject to change.

Basket is another application which enables you to have a single desktop application to run web-apps like Whatsapp, Telegram, Slack & every single web-app you can think of.

If you'd like to use a web-app which is not currently supported (features like notification count and such) I'm more than happy to accept a pull request.

_Once there is a final version there will be a readme how to make such pull request._

Basket is free & open source and will never include any paid plans.

Highly inspired by apps like <a href="https://github.com/meetfranz/franz/">Franz</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ramboxapp/community-edition">Rambox</a>.
